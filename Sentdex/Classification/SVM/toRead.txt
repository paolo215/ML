Support Vectory Machine 
	- a binary classifier 
	- separate data into two groups. 
	- Positives and Negatives

Magnitude = ||A||
	sqrt(a^2 + b^2)


Dot product = A . B
	A = [a,b]
	B = [c,d]
	A . B = (a * c) + (b * d)
	This is a scalar value


***Support Vector Assertion p22 NOTES
equation to devirate support vector:
	y(i) = class of feature
	x = unknown vector
	w = vector perpendicular to the hyperplane
	y(i) * (x . w + bias) - 1 = 0
